# New-York-Lottery-Numbers
Project of exploratory data analysis of New York Lottery Winning Numbers from Data.gov

Several different historic data sets sourced from data.gov on different New York Lottery winning numbers. 

Frequencies and distrobutions will be examined to look for any suspicious trends.  

The expectation is that none will be found.... but you never know.
